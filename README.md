# Grammer Guru
## Overview
The Grammar App is an innovative Flutter-based mobile application that empowers users to improve their grammar. Utilizing adaptive learning with a unique scoring system informed by Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and a custom algorithm, the app provides a personalized experience, adapting the difficulty of grammar exercises based on user performance.

## Features
1. Real-Time Grammar Correction: Offers instant feedback on users' writing, highlighting errors and providing corrective suggestions.
2. Adaptive Learning: Each sentence's grammar difficulty is tailored to the user's proficiency, gauged by a scoring system that utilizes Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and a custom algorithm. This ensures personalized progression through the learning material.
3. Gamification: Incorporates a gamified approach with drag-and-drop exercises that adjust in difficulty according to user performance, creating a motivating and rewarding learning experience.
4. Grammar Chatbot: An AI-powered chatbot to answer user queries and provide grammar assistance in a conversational manner.
5. Analysis Page: Offers users a detailed breakdown of their performance, tracking progress and highlighting areas for improvement.
6. Guidelines Page: Provides comprehensive grammar rules and tips to assist users in their learning journey.
7. Interactive Learning: Enables users to engage with the correction process, with in-depth explanations to help understand and learn from errors.
8. User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, the appâ€™s interface provides a straightforward and distraction-free environment for learning.

## Technical Details
1. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT): Employs BKT to track user understanding and tailor the learning path to individual needs.
2. Proprietary Algorithm: Our own algorithm works hand-in-hand with BKT to dynamically adjust the difficulty of grammar tasks, ensuring optimal learning progression.
3. State Management: Handled with Provider for state management to maintain a responsive and well-organized codebase.
4. Asynchronous Communication: Managed effectively using FutureProvider and StreamProvider, connecting the app to a machine learning backend for grammar analysis.
